Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security flaw where an attacker inserts harmful code, often in the form of script tags or HTML elements, into web applications. 
This malicious code is then stored on the server and executed whenever other users interact with the compromised content, potentially leading to unauthorized actions.
Here stored cross-site scripting (XSS) was identified in the comment field associated with the wordpress posts created using WP All Import plugin.

1. Install WordPress 6.4.1 and add WP All Import 3.7.3 plugin
2. Create a New Import for WordPress Posts. Navigate to All Import > New Import > Select Import file > Confirm & Run import
3. Navigate to Posts section from the left side of the dashboard menu > All Posts > click on the post which we have created.
4. Scroll down to the comment section, insert the stored XSS payload and proceed to publish the comment.
5. Refresh the page and observe XSS is triggered.
